The Idea of this project sparkled up in my mind when I was watching the movie INTERSTELLAR. I found the Black hole very fascinationg and I was craving to get know better and better about Black holes.
That is how this project was in sight and born. 

METHODOLOGY:
I used my own simple methodology which I call it "Trunk-Branch-Leaf method"

TRUNK-BRANCH-LEAF METHOD:
1. Firstly, I noted down all the major topics of research done up to the date of summer 2025. (TRUNK)
2. Secondly, I then noted down the sub-topics within these major topics of the research noted down. (BRANCH)
3. Finally, I extracted data of each and every subtopic in an order from one to another in a manner. (LEAF)

This own methodology worked flawlessly in this specific project.
