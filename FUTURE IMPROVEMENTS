At the time of the Project completion, I was never satisfied like this ever before. 
Way after the completion, I realized something that would have made this project better. If I were to do the same type of project again one day, I would use the same method, technique, and with the 
following improvements.

IMPROVEMENTS: In an order 
1. Firstly, I would add a verification layer to the data collected by using online information sources like WWW.wikipedia.com
2. Then, I will analyze the data and its efficiency.
3. Next, I will make a report which explains about the great things and mistakes (like wrong data/grammar) which the AI has implemented.
4. Finally, if possible, I will provide better solutions and prompting techniques for better efficiency of the AI.

I believe that these improvements will significantly make this project more complete and will have a better report and purpose for this project.
